  Designed by Tom Fazio and opened for play in 1996, the Wanamaker Course is the
  first golf course named in honor of department store magnate Rodman Wanamaker,
  whose vision in 1916 to organize a national association of golf professionals
  inspired the birth of the PGA of America. A classic Florida layout, the
  Wanamaker Course features wetlands, palm trees and palmettos, and is
  considered one of Florida’s most beautiful courses. Among recent upgrades, the
  Wanamaker Course now features a hybrid Bermuda, with some common Bermuda
  genes; bunker faces are filled with Empire zoysia, which has outstanding
  density; and the bridges at the No. 3 and 16 tees were rebuilt.

The PGA Jones Cup, named for the 1985-97 Mississippi State PGA Golf Management University Program Director, Dr. S. Roland Jones, is an annual college tournament for PGA Golf Management students. Held over two days, the tournament is comprised of two 18-hole stroke play rounds. The top four scores for each five-person team are counted towards the team’s cumulative score. Teams are decided by each school’s program director.

The 2017 tournament saw a field of 95 players from each of the PGA’s accredited university programs. Campbell University defeated two-year reigning Champion New Mexico State by four strokes to win their fifth Championship since 2007—the most of any program since the tournament’s inception in 2002.
