  Designed by Tom Fazio and opened for play in 1996, the Wanamaker Course is the
  first golf course named in honor of department store magnate Rodman Wanamaker,
  whose vision in 1916 to organize a national association of golf professionals
  inspired the birth of the PGA of America. A classic Florida layout, the
  Wanamaker Course features wetlands, palm trees and palmettos, and is
  considered one of Florida’s most beautiful courses. Among recent upgrades, the
  Wanamaker Course now features a hybrid Bermuda, with some common Bermuda
  genes; bunker faces are filled with Empire zoysia, which has outstanding
  density; and the bridges at the No. 3 and 16 tees were rebuilt.

The annual PGA WORKS Collegiate Championship is a 54-hole stroke-play tournament. The tournament consists of four team divisions—NCAA Men’s Division I, Men’s Division II, Men’s NAIA and an overall Women’s division—and both men’s and women’s individual championships. Participation in the Individual Invitational is not restricted to predominately minority-serving institutions. However, participants must be in one of the ethnic origins listed: African-American, Hispanic-American, Middle Eastern/North African, Native or Alaskan American, Asian or Pacific Island American.

The PGA WORKS Collegiate Championship originated in November 1986 following the Jackson State University Golf Tournament and has elevated golf in minority colleges and universities by providing opportunities to more players to compete in a national championship. The inaugural Championship was conducted in the spring of 1987 at Highland Park Golf Course in Cleveland. Since 1998, PGA Golf Club in Port St. Lucie, Florida, has been host to the Championship.
