Since 1997, the Junior Ryder Cup has showcased the extraordinary talent of golfâ€™s next generation. The matches have featured young performances from some of the best golfers of today, including: Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Hunter Mahan, Tony Finau, Lexi Thompson, Alison Lee and Brittany Altomare of the United States; and Rory McIllroy, Sergio Garcia, Nicolas Colsaerts, Suzann Pettersen, Emily Pedersen and Carlota Ciganda of Europe.&nbsp;

Played biennially prior to the Ryder Cup, the Junior Ryder Cup competition features one day of six foursome matches (three boys matches and three girls matches) in the morning, and six mixed four-ball matches in the afternoon. On the second and final day, all 12 team members compete in singles matches.

Boys and girls must be 2021 high school graduates or younger; must not have reached their 19th birthday by the start of the competition; and must be American citizens to be eligible to represent the United States Junior Ryder Cup Team. The 12-member team consists of six boys and six girls, who earn berths through results from the 2017/2018 PGA of America Junior events and USGA national events.
