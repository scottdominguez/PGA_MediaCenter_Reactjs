The Girls Junior PGA Championship features a four-day, 72-hole stroke-play format with a cut after 36 holes to the low 70-plus ties. Girls 18 and younger are eligible to play and qualify through their local PGA Section. Past competitors include: Cristie Kerr, InBee Park, Michelle Wie, Dottie Pepper, and Lexi Thompson. The 2019 Championship will feature a field of 144 competitors vying for the Patty Berg Trophy at Keney Park Golf Course in Hartford, Connecticut.

The 2018 champion, Yealimi Noh, took the lead in the second round and never looked back.&nbsp; Her record-setting performance of 24-under-par total made a statement after finishing second in the 2017 Championship.&nbsp; Her performance was stellar, with 25 birdies on the week and just one bogey.&nbsp;
