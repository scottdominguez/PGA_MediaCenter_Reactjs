  Located in Rochester, N.Y., Oak Hill Country Club’s East Course has been home
  to some of golf’s most iconic championships. The Club began its Championship
  reputation in 1949 after hosting the U.S. Amateur, which saw Charlie Coe
  defeat Rufus King in a landslide 11-and-10 match victory. Seven years later in
  1956, Oak Hill hosted its first of three U.S. Opens.


  The course has also been home to numerous PGA of America events, including
  three PGA Championships (1980, 2003, 2013) and the 1995 Ryder Cup that saw a
  miraculous European comeback to win 14 ½ to 13 ½. This will be Oak Hill’s
  second KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship.

The most historic and prestigious major championship in senior golf, the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship celebrates its 80th edition in 2019. The Championship was born on the grounds of another of golf ’s majors at the invitation of one of the game’s greatest players. At the suggestion of renowned amateur Bobby Jones, the inaugural KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship was conducted at Augusta National Golf Club in 1937, just three years after the first Masters Tournament.

The KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship returns to Oak Hill Country Club's historic East Course in Rochester, N.Y., in 2019. The Championship was last played at the venue in 2008, when Jay Haas defeated Bernhard Langer by one-stroke to win his second Alfred S. Bourne Trophy in three years. Haas' winning score of 7-over-par remains the highest scoring Championship since the tournament’s switch to the 72-hole format in 1958.
