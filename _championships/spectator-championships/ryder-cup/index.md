  The rugged, open and windswept terrain of Whistling Straits is the defining
  element of the course. Sitting upon Lake Michigan and designed by hall-of-fame
  designer Pete Dye, The Straits’ fescue fairways and grand dune bunkers are
  reminiscent to classic Irish links. The venue has been host to numerous major
  championships, including the 2004, 2005 and 2015 PGA Championship, as well as
  the 2007 U.S. Senior Open.

The Ryder Cup is one of the most spirited, exciting and compelling events in sports. It spans nearly 90 years, involves the greatest players in the world and produces some of the greatest moments in the game. The competition officially began in 1927 when enterprising English seed merchant Samuel Ryder presented a gold cup that bears his name. The U.S. team defeated Great Britain, 9 ½ to 2 ½, in the inaugural matches in Worcester, Massachusetts.

Since then, the Ryder Cup has expanded to involve the finest players of Europe. Except for a span (1939-45) during World War II and following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks upon America, the Ryder Cup has been held biennially with the U.S. and Europe alternating as host.

The 2020 Ryder Cup will be held at the historic Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin—the site of the 2007 U.S. Senior Open and the 2004, 2010 and 2015 PGA Championships.&nbsp;
