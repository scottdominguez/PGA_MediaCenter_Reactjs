In 2019, the 65th KPMG Women’s PGA Championship, one of the LPGA Tour’s five majors, will head to the historic Hazeltine National Golf Club, home of the electric 2016 Ryder Cup. Broadcast in partnership with NBC and Golf Channel, the Championship’s purse is one of the largest on the LPGA Tour. The event combines an annual major golf championship with the KPMG Women’s Leadership Summit and an ongoing charitable initiative called the KPMG Future Leaders Program – all focused on the development, advancement, and empowerment of women on and off the golf course.
