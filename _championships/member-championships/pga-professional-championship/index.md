  East Course:


  A private golf community in Blufton, S.C., Belfair’s two courses feature two
  distinct designs. The East Course was inspired by traditional Scottish links,
  with naturalized sand areas, native grasses, and a wide-open layout. The East
  Course’s open style feels more reminiscent to a great Florida course than a
  typical South Carolina design and offers an exciting golf experience.



  West Course:


  The Tom Fazio’s West Course is a parkland-style course, featuring tall pines
  and oaks. Along with multiple tee boxes on each hole and a hole with two green
  options, Fazio’s design is dynamic and allows players to experience a
  different course which each round. The last five holes are played along the
  Colleton River and a low-country saltwater marsh, which provide a beautiful,
  but challenging finish.

Because of the PGA Championship’s move to May in 2019, the 52nd PGA Professional Championship at Belfair will be held in April 2019. The massive 312 player field is made up entirely of PGA Professionals. Winners receive the Walter Hagen Cup and automatic exemptions to six PGA Tour events over a 12-month period, the 2020 PGA Cup, and one of golf’s most prestigious championships—the 2019 PGA Championship. The top 20 PGA Professionals also receive exemptions into the 2019 PGA Championship.

The tournament will consist of four rounds of stroke play on two courses. Cuts are made after 36 holes of the low 90-plus ties, and low 70-plus ties after 54.
