  Designed by Tom Fazio and opened for play in 1996, the Wanamaker Course is the
  first golf course named in honor of department store magnate Rodman Wanamaker,
  whose vision in 1916 to organize a national association of golf professionals
  inspired the birth of the PGA of America. A classic Florida layout, the
  Wanamaker Course features wetlands, palm trees and palmettos, and is
  considered one of Floridaâ€™s most beautiful courses. Among recent upgrades, the
  Wanamaker Course now features a hybrid Bermuda, with some common Bermuda
  genes; bunker faces are filled with Empire zoysia, which has outstanding
  density; and the bridges at the No. 3 and 16 tees were rebuilt.
