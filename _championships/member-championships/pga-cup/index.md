hole_by_hole_summary_description: "Tom Fazio has done enough spectacular golf courses that, like a proud father, he doesn’t pick out favorites, at least publicly. But it didn’t take him long to realize when he first stepped on the Barton Creek property, he was standing on special ground. “People ask me all the time if I can see a hole or course when I’m out for the first time,” Fazio recalled of his first visit to Barton Creek for what would be his initial Texas course. “I didn’t envision this course, but I knew it would be a dramatic site.”\n\t\nHis insight and perseverance paid off as the Foothills Course has been chosen as the No. 1 Resort Course in Texas for multiple years, ranked as high as No. 4 in the U.S. The former site of the Champions Tour Legends of Golf tournament has gained honors aplenty since opening in 1986, and has wowed legions of golfers, pros and amateurs, from future presidents to thoroughly hooked hackers, with its beauty and challenge.\n\t\nThe Fazio Foothills course recently completed a full renovation in 2018 that included tree removal, new tee boxes and all bunkers being redone and even some redesigned. The Fazio team worked with Barton Creek Country Club to rejuvenate one of the most beautiful courses in the state.\n\t\nAt one time or another at least half of the holes at Fazio Foothills have been listed in a statewide survey as the prettiest or the toughest in Texas.\n\t\nForget about a signature hole, at Fazio Foothills, you have a signature course."

The PGA Cup is a biennially contested match between PGA Professionals of the United States and Great Britain & Ireland. Identical to the Ryder Cup, the PGA Cup is a match play tournament, consisting of multiple matches in foursomes (two-man teams in alternate shot); four-ball (two-man teams in better ball); and singles (18 holes at match play). Each team is made up of 10 players. No prize money is awarded to competitors in the PGA Cup. Members of both teams compete solely for their country and their country’s right of possession of the Llandudno International Golf Trophy.

Only PGA of America Members in good standing are eligible for the U.S. team. Membership on the PGA Cup Team will be forfeited should the player subsequently become re-classified as a Tour professional or any other ineligible classification.
