  Fazio Foothills:


  Designed by Tom Fazio, the Fazio Foothills course was recently ranked as one
  of the top courses in Texas by Golf Magazine. Running at 7,125 yards in
  length, Fazio’s course is a shot-maker’s paradise. The course is protected by
  cliffs, waterfalls and creeks, making for a beautiful, scenic round, but also
  emphasizes the importance of accuracy. Drives from the elevated tee boxes must
  be precise to hit the Hybrid TIFSport Bermuda-grass fairway, and even more so
  when approaching the small, TiffEagle Bermuda greens. Stray shots may find the
  grass bunkers or one of the many other unfavorable lies that are sure to ruin
  one’s score. Previously, the Fazio Foothill’s course was home to the Champions
  Tour Legends of Golf tournament from 1990-1994.



  Coore Crenshaw:


  A collaboration between course architect Bill Coore and two-time Masters
  Champion, Ben Crenshaw, the Coore Course at Omni Barton Creek Resort & Spa is
  designed with the ideology that nature is the best architect. Although the
  holes feature lush, wide fairways, the dense trees to their sides will swallow
  any ball that misses its mark. However, the real challenge is found on the
  large, undulated greens that are sure to stump and frustrate players. 


  The course’s beauty is really seen in the signature 18th hole. Running
  slightly uphill, approach shots must carry a creek to the low-lying green
  which is designed to appear as though it was carved into the hillside.
