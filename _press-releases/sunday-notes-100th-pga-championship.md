**BROOKS KOEPKA WINS THE 100th PGA CHAMPIONSHIP**<br>Brooks Koepka (69-63-66-66, 264) posted a closing 4-under 66 to win the 100th PGA Championship by two shots at Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis. Koepka, 28, entered play Sunday with a 2-shot advantage, but his lead evaporated as Adam Scott birdied 10, 12 and 13. Koepka answered with 10-foot and 7-foot birdie putts on Nos. 15 and 16 to reset the buffer he began the day with and ultimately won by. Tiger Woods (266) closed with a 64 to finish in second place, while Adam Scott’s 67 to put him in third at 267.

**NEW 72-HOLE RECORD**<br>At 264, Brooks Koepka set the lowest 72-hole score in a PGA Championship, eclipsing David Toms's 265 carded in 2001.

Tiger Woods, who finished with a 266, joins Phil Mickelson (2001) for the lowest 72-hole score by a non-winner at the PGA Championship.

**BROOKS JOINS AN EXCLUSIVE LIST**<br>By securing his third major today, Brooks Koepka joins Tiger Woods (2000), Jack Nicklaus (1980), Ben Hogan (1948) and Gene Sarazen (1922) as the only players to win the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open in the same year.

**HIS FAIR SHARE**<br>Dating to his first U.S. Open victory in June of 2017, Brooks Koepka has won three of his last six major championships played. Koepka did not play in the 2018 Masters due to injury.

**THE POWER OF 3**<br>Brooks Koepka, by winning Sunday at Bellerive, became the 18th player with exactly three career major championship victories. He joins a long list that includes, but is not limited to, Billy Casper, Jordan Spieth, Vijay Singh, Payne Stewart, Nick Price and Padraig Harrington.

**SEMINOLES TO LIFT THE WANAMAKER**<br>With his win today at Bellerive, Brooks Koepka became the fourth Florida State alum to win the Wanamaker Trophy. Koepka joins Hubert Green (1985), Jeff Sluman (1988) and Paul Azinger (1993) on the list.

**SOLO 2ND FOR TIGER**<br>Tiger Woods finished alone in second place at the 100th PGA Championship. This is the seventh time Tiger has recorded a runner-up in a major championship, and his first since the 2009 PGA Championship.

**SCOTT’S RUN FALLS SHORT**<br>Adam Scott’s third-place finish marks his fifth top 10 at the PGA Championship in 18 appearances and his first since 2013 (T-5). Overall, Scott owns 17 top 10s in major championships, but only two have come since a T-10 at the 2015 Open Championship (T-9, 2017 Masters; 3, 2018 PGA Championship).

**TIGER WINS “100 YEARS OF GREATNESS” ULTIMATE BRACKET**<br>Tiger Woods and Bob May’s epic duel at Valhalla Golf Club in 2000 edged John Daly’s historic 1991 triumph at Crooked Stick as the all-time greatest PGA Championship. The final result: Tiger Woods 2000 (53.58%) vs. John Daly 1991 (46.42%)

“The 100 Years of Greatest” contest, shaped in an “Ultimate Bracket,” attracted voters worldwide online and through social media. The campaign, which began on July 8, encouraged golf enthusiasts to learn more about what an international media panel determined were the most compelling PGA Championships. The No. 1 all-time greatest PGA Championship was announced Sunday by CBS during its telecast of the 100th PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis.
