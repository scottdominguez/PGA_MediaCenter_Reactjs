OLYMPIA FIELDS, Ill. – KPMG announced today that it will extend its title sponsorship agreement with the PGA of America and the LPGA through 2023 for the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship.

This week, the Championship celebrates its third consecutive partnership year between KPMG, the PGA of America and the LPGA at Olympia Fields (Illinois) Country Club. The extension means KPMG and its partners will continue to showcase the advancement and empowerment of women on and off the golf course.

Broadcast in partnership with NBC and Golf Channel, the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship connects a major golf championship with a women’s leadership summit (KPMG Women’s Leadership Summit) and an ongoing charitable initiative (KPMG Future Leaders Program) to inspire and develop new generations of women leaders.

The Championship, featuring a $3.5 million purse, is operated by the PGA of America in close collaboration with the LPGA. The partnership in 2015 debuted by taking the Championship to the Westchester Country Club in Harrison, New York; in 2016 at Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish, Washington; and this week at Olympia Fields.

The purse size will increase to $3.65 million when the Championship heads to Kemper Lakes Golf Club in Kildeer, Illinois in 2018. Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota will be the host site in 2019.

“The KPMG Women’s PGA Championship provides a fantastic platform for us to demonstrate our commitment to elevating women in business and the sport of golf through the Championship, KPMG Women’s Leadership Summit, and KPMG Future Leaders Program,” said Lynne Doughtie, KPMG U.S. Chairman and CEO.&nbsp; “Together with the PGA of America and LPGA, we’ll continue to empower more women leaders in the years ahead.”

“Three years ago, a historic partnership for a great championship was realized thanks to KPMG. Today, we begin an exciting new chapter,” said PGA of America Chief Executive Officer Pete Bevacqua. “KPMG’s off-course dedication to excellence, along with premier venues such as Olympia Fields this week – and Kemper Lakes and Hazeltine National in years to come – ensure that this Championship shines on the world golf stage.”

“The KPMG Women's PGA Championship is the result of an incredible partnership that has elevated every aspect of this Championship,” said LPGA Commissioner Mike Whan. “At the LPGA, we are honored to stand side-by-side with the PGA of America and KPMG to not only provide the best female golfers a more meaningful and impressive major stage, but also commit to a similar elevation in leadership opportunities for women in the workplace.”

The KPMG Women’s PGA Championship continues the rich tradition of the LPGA Championship, which began in 1955, five years after the birth of the Ladies Professional Golf Association. Past champions include World Golf Hall of Fame members Mickey Wright, Betsy Rawls, Kathy Whitworth, Nancy Lopez, Juli Inkster, Annika Sorenstam, Se Ri Pak and newest LPGA Hall of Famer, Inbee Park.

The KPMG Women’s PGA Championship field of 156 features the top eight finishers from the previous year’s LPGA Teaching & Club Professional National Championship, including PGA of America women members if they rank among the eight positions. Additionally, the field includes the current PGA Women’s Stroke Play Champion. &nbsp;

KPMG will continue to host the KPMG Women’s Leadership Summit on-site during Championship week, which brings together top leaders in business, politics, sports, and the media to inspire the next generation of women leaders.

The extension also continues a shared commitment to give back through the KPMG Future Leaders Program, an ongoing charitable initiative funded by proceeds from the Championship and Summit.

The KPMG Future Leaders Program affords top female high school seniors across the country the opportunity to enhance their personal growth through college scholarships, a leadership development retreat at Stanford University, a mentoring relationship with a woman business leader, and an introduction to golf.
