**THE BOYS ARE BACK TOGETHER**<br>With the automatic qualifying and the initial eight spots on the U.S. Ryder Cup team that will be determined with it slated to wrap up this weekend, it’s fun to note that each of the 12 playing members of the victorious 2016 U.S. Ryder Cup Team are in the field for the 100th PGA Championship: Rickie Fowler, J.B. Holmes, Dustin Johnson, Zach Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Ryan Moore, Patrick Reed, Brandt Snedeker, Jordan Spieth and Jimmy Walker.

As for Ryder Cup Europe, 11 of the 12 members of their 2016 squad are at Bellerive: Rafa Cabrera Bello, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Sergio Garcia, Martin Kaymer, Rory McIlroy, Thomas Pieters, Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson, Andy Sullivan, Danny Willett and Chris Wood. The lone missing member of the team is Lee Westwood, who withdrew from the Championship last weekend.

It should be noted that the last PGA Champion with previous U.S. Ryder Cup experience was Jason Dufner, who played in the 2012 Ryder Cup at Medinah 11 months before winning the PGA Championship at Oak Hill.

**‘18 MAJOR CHAMPS SEEK A RARE FEAT**<br>The three 2018 major champions (Patrick Reed, Brooks Koepka, and Francesco Molinari) have the opportunity to add their names to an exclusive list this week at Bellerive: those who have claimed both the Masters, U.S. Open, or Open Championship in the same calendar year as the PGA Championship.<br>![](/uploads/majors.PNG)<br>Reed and Molinari are both coming off their best performance in a PGA Championship last year at Quail Hollow Club (T-2), while Koepka owns four consecutive top-15 finishes in the event.

**26 AND COUNTING FOR PHIL**<br>2005 Champion Phil Mickelson is playing in his 26th consecutive PGA Championship this week, which is the longest active streak among those in the field. Mickelson’s PGA Championship streak is not, however, the longest among all those in St. Louis this week. Davis Love III played in 27 consecutive PGA Championships from 1989-2015, but his string came to an end when he missed the 2016 Championship at Baltusrol due to injury (hip surgery).

**WELCOME BACK, PAUL**<br>Paul Broadhurst, the 2018 KitchenAid Senior PGA Champion, is playing in his third PGA Championship this week. It is his first since 2006. Broadhurst’s 12-year gap between PGA Championship appearances is the longest among those in the field this week at Bellerive.

**MIXED BAG FOR EVENTUAL CHAMPIONS**<br>The year prior to a PGA Champion’s victory has not always indicated that success is imminent. Of the past 10 PGA Championship winners, only two finished in the top 10 the previous year:<br>![](blob:https://app.cloudcannon.com/14282e1a-e19b-4f48-b986-a5fadd02b62d)

**TWO-BY-FOUR**<br>Two PGA Club Professionals in the field this week will be playing in their fourth consecutive PGA Championship, which is noteworthy as the 312-player field for the PGA Professional Championship yields only 20 spots annually in the PGA Championship. Matt Dobyns of Glen Head, New York and Omar Uresti of Austin, Texas, share the longest active streak of PGA Championships played among PGA Club Professionals.

**OZZIE’S HONOR**<br>Wednesday afternoon at the PGA Media Center, St. Louis resident and National Baseball Hall-of-Famer Ozzie Smith was recognized as the first-ever PGA Championship Host City Champion for his work to not only bring the 100th PGA Championship toi Missouri, but for his remarkable work as President of the Gateway PGA REACH Foundation. Smith works on behalf of St. Louis and his Gateway PGA Section were celebrated by a dozen sporting or broadcasting friends: NFL Hall-of-Famers Marcus Allen and Aeneas Williams; Cardinals play-by-play voice Mike Shannon; Baseball Hall-of-Famer/former Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog; original 1967 Blues defenseman Bob Plager, U.S. Hockey Hall-of-Famer Keith Tkachuk; Hockey Hall-of-Famers Bernie Federko and Al MacInnis; current Blues sniper Vladimir Tarasenko; former Cardinals/national broadcaster Jay Randolph, the lead voice of the U.S. Open, World Series and NFL on Fox Joe Buck; and the greatest female athlete in history/six-time U.S. Olympic Gold Medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Bob Costas, a longtime friend of Smith, was unfortunately not able to attend due to a flight cancellation.
