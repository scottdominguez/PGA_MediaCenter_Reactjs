United States Ryder Cup Captain Jim Furyk today announced that Tony Finau has been added to the U.S. Team as the final Captain’s selection for the 42nd Ryder Cup, which will be contested Sept. 28-30 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.

Finau joins Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods as Furyk’s four Captain’s Selections. Furyk named DeChambeau, Mickelson and Woods to the U.S. Team on Sept. 4.

"He has an unbelievable body of work this year," said Furyk. "All those top-10 finishes, the play in big championships and the Majors, and then his current form, a second, a fourth and an eighth in the playoffs. He checked a lot of boxes and made it impossible not to pick him."

Although this will be Finau’s first Ryder Cup, he has posted 11 top-10s this season, including three in major-championship play (T-10/Masters, 5th/U.S. Open, T-9/Open Championship).

A consistent presence on Sunday leaderboards throughout the year, Finau’s second-place finish at last month’s Northern Trust was his third runner-up of the season. The 28-year-old (he’ll be 29 when Ryder Cup play begins) ranks third on the PGA Tour with an average driving distance of 316.3 yards. He’s currently No. 17 in the Official World Golf Ranking.

“It’s a dream come true for me,” said Finau. “I got the goosebumps when he told me, and I’m excited to add my skills and talent to the team, a team that’s stacked already. Hopefully I bring something to the team that can help us bring that Cup back.”

The final composition of Furyk’s 2018 U.S. Ryder Cup Team includes three Ryder Cup rookies (DeChambeau, Finau, Thomas), nine major champions (with 31 total major victories) and experience gained in 34 previous Ryder Cups.
