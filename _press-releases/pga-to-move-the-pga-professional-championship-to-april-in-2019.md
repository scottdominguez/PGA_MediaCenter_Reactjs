CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Beginning in 2019, the PGA Professional Championship, the largest all-professional national golf event, will be conducted in late April as a result of new competition dates for the PGA Championship, which will move to May 16-19, 2019.

The 2019 PGA Professional Championship will be played April 28-May 1, at a site to be determined. The Championship has been played in June since 1997.

The 2018 Championship will be conducted June 17-20, at Bayonet Black Horse in Seaside, California.

PGA Club Professionals in the 312-member PGA Professional Championship presented by Club Car, Mercedes-Benz and OMEGA, will continue to compete for 20 berths in the PGA Championship.

“The shift in dates for these two Championships opens an exciting new chapter in the annual PGA golf calendar, but the essence of the PGA Professional Championship - our showcase event for PGA Professionals – will not change,” said PGA of America President Paul Levy. “PGA Members will continue to have the opportunity to compete for a national championship and the low 20 scorers will advance in a matter of weeks to compete on a world stage in the PGA Championship.”

The PGA Professional Championship field is comprised of players who advanced from the 41 PGA Section Championships, along with Past Champions.

All four rounds of the Championship are broadcast live on Golf Channel.

Begun in 1968 to provide additional playing opportunities for PGA Professionals, the PGA Professional Championship features the finest playing PGA Members in the Association. The Championship has been played in 16 states in the previous 50 years: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Wisconsin.
