PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (February 13, 2019) – PGA of America President Suzy Whaley will captain the United States Team that will compete in the inaugural Women’s PGA Cup – a first-of-its-kind team competition for women PGA Members from around the world. The international showcase event is Oct. 22-26, at Omni Barton Creek Resort & Spa, in Austin, Texas.  

Representatives from six PGA governing bodies are anticipated in the Women’s PGA Cup field: Australia, Canada, Great Britain & Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. The field will compete in a 54-hole, stroke-play format, with each team’s lowest three scores counted after each round. The winning country will be the team with the lowest 54-hole aggregate total.

Whaley, a PGA and LPGA Member, is a PGA Master Professional and the PGA Director of Instruction at The Country Club of Mirasol in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. She also is the PGA Director of Instruction for Suzy Whaley Golf in Cromwell, Connecticut. Whaley competed on the LPGA Tour in 1990 and 1993; and in 2003, was the second woman in history to qualify for a PGA Tour event, the Greater Hartford Open.

Each national team in the Women’s PGA Cup will be composed of five players and one Captain, who also may be a playing or non-playing captain at the option of the respective country.

“I look upon this captaincy as a premier honor in my career, as I represent women professionals who fill so many invaluable roles at their local facilities along with playing the game at the highest level,” said Whaley. “It’s exciting on so many levels for our women PGA Members. The potential of this event is tremendous and we believe it will help grow women’s professional golf. It’s such a great opportunity for women PGA Professionals from around the world to showcase their skills and I am trying hard to earn a spot on the team.”

The Women’s PGA Cup does not include a purse. Rather, each team will vie for bragging rights and the honor of winning the Cup, and bask in the pride that comes with representing one’s country in a distinct and unique international competition.

Those eligible to represent their country in the Women’s PGA Cup must be Members in good standing with their respective Professional Golfers Association (PGA). They must also be active in the game, be it as a teacher, coach or working as Club Professional/Assistant. Tour professionals who primarily compete for a living are not eligible to participate.

The five members of the inaugural USA Team will be determined following the 2019 LPGA Teaching and Club Professional Championship, on Aug. 28, and includes the following criteria:

* Performance of eligible top-20 finishers in the 2018 & 2019 Women’s Stroke Play Championship and the 2018 & 2019 LPGA Teaching & Club Professional Championship.
* Top 10 finishers in the final money list for the 2018 PGA Tournament Series.
* Women PGA Members making the cut at the 2018 and/or 2019 KPMG Women’s PGA Championship; the 2018 and/or 2019 USGA Women’s Open; and the 2018 and/or 2019 PGA Professional Championship.
* Women PGA Members making the cut in any LPGA “Official” event from January 2018 through Aug. 28, 2019.
* At the PGA Section level, points will be based on a formula that weighs both the number of eligible women PGA Members in each of the PGA of America’s 41 Sections with an individual’s prize money earned at the Section level.

Beyond the United States, each participating country’s PGA Association will identify its captain and team through its own selection process. Likewise, each competing PGA Association will be responsible for selecting the criteria for captaincy
