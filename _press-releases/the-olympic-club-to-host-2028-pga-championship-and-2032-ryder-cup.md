PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. – The PGA of America announced today that The Olympic Club in San Francisco will host the 2028 PGA Championship and the 2032 Ryder Cup.<br><br>This will be the first time the PGA of America will stage any of its pillar events at The Olympic Club, which sports a rich championship heritage having hosted 10 USGA events, including five U.S. Opens, on its famed Lake Course.<br><br>“This is a special moment for our Association, to return the PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup to the West Coast,” said PGA of America President Paul Levy. “We’re excited to showcase The Olympic Club and its Lake Course, and combine them with the many tastes, sights and sounds that make San Francisco and the Bay Area so distinct.”<br><br>The PGA Championship is the only all-professional major in men’s golf. It began in 1916, just months after the birth of the PGA of America and today features one of the deepest international fields in golf. Since 1994, it has perennially featured the most top-100 players in the Official World Golf Rankings of all golf Championships.<br><br>The Ryder Cup, golf’s most compelling event, began in 1927, bringing together the finest tour professionals from the United States and Europe. In September 2018, Europe will host the U.S. in the 42nd Ryder Cup in the shadows of Paris, at Le Golf National in Guyancourt, France.<br><br>“Our membership is elated to host the PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup, two more gems that add to the rich multi-sport history of America’s oldest athletic club,” said Dan Dillon, President of The Olympic Club, which was founded in 1860. “Our collective anticipation for these signature events has already begun as we look forward to again welcoming golf’s finest players to the famed Lake Course. I also want to thank the PGA of America for this opportunity, their partnership and service to the game of golf.”<br><br>The Olympic Club's Lake Course, designed by Willie Watson and built by club superintendent Sam Whiting, opened in 1924. After winter weather damage, Whiting redesigned the course in 1927. Its roster of champions includes Jack Fleck (18-hole playoff victory over Ben Hogan in 1955), Billy Casper (18-hole playoff over Arnold Palmer in ’66), Scott Simpson (1987), Lee Janzen (1998) and Webb Simpson (2012).<br><br>These 2028 and 2032 events provide Bay Area golf fans three PGA of America events during a 13-year window (2020-2032), as the 2020 PGA Championship will be played at Harding Park, a San Francisco municipal course located just a few miles from The Olympic Club.<br><br>The PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup are two of the PGA of America's pillar events, along with the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship and the KPMG Women's PGA Championship.
