**BROOKS IS BEING BROOKS**<br>For the first time in his career, Brooks Koepka will sleep on sole possession of a 54-hole lead in a major championship. Koepka leads the 100th PGA Championship by 2 shots over Adam Scott. Thirteen players, including seven major champions, are within 5 shots of Koepka, who is the two-time defending U.S. Open Champion.

**EYE OF THE TIGER**<br>If third-round leader Brooks Koepka can maintain his lead for 18 more holes, he’ll become the first player to win the PGA Championship and U.S. Open in the same year since Tiger Woods in 2000. The last person to simultaneously “own” both the Wanamaker and the U.S. Open Championship Trophy was … Tiger Woods, who won the 2007 PGA Championship and the 2008 U.S. Open just 10 months apart.

**GOING SOLO**<br>Two-time major champion Brooks Koepka (2017 and 2018 U.S. Opens) has not held the solo 54-hole lead in either of his major victories. At Erin Hills in 2017, Koepka trailed Brian Harman by one stroke, while this year at Shinnecock Hills he shared the lead with Daniel Berger, Tony Finau, and Dustin Johnson.

Koepka has entered the final round of a PGA Tour event with the solo lead twice in his career: 2013 Safeway Open and 2016 AT&T Byron Nelson, neither resulting in a victory (T-3 and 2nd).

**BOGEY-FREE RUN**<br>Brooks Koepka doubled his sixth hole of the Championship on Thursday, but followed with 43 straight pars or better. Along the way, he carded consecutive 9-hole tallies of 32-32-31-30.

**FIRST TIME SINCE ’07 FOR TIGER**<br>Tiger Woods has posted front-nine 31s in consecutive rounds at Bellerive (2 & 3). The last time Woods posted a 9-hole score this low came in the 2007 PGA Championship at Southern Hills – the site of his fourth Championship victory.

**NIGHT AND DAY**<br>Woods is collectively 10-under par (33-31-31) on the front nine at Bellerive, pairing 11 birdies with just one bogey. The back nine has posed more of a challenge for the 4-time PGA Champion. Woods is +2 coming in (37-35-35).

**COME FROM BEHIND**<br>In each of Tiger Woods’s four PGA Championship victories, he held at least a share of the 54-hole lead. If he pulls off his 15th major championship win tomorrow, it will be his first come-from-behind victory on a Sunday at the PGA Championship.

**PAT ON THE BACK**<br>After three rounds, Pat Perez’s eye is on Brooks Koepka, as he is only 6 shots back of the 54-hole leader. Perez is within striking distance of just his second career top-10 finish in a major championship. Perez tied for 6th in the 2005 PGA Championship at Baltusrol.

**WALL-ACE**<br>Matt Wallace of London, England, recorded the first hole-in-one of the 100th PGA Championship Saturday, using a 5-iron on the 232-yard No. 16 hole. Wallace is making his debut in the PGA Championship.

**TEXAN BEN KERN SHINES AT LOW CLUB PROFESSIONAL**<br>Ben Kern of Round Rock, Texas, a PGA Head Professional at Georgetown (Texas) Country Club, posted a bogey-free 3-under-par 67 Saturday to share 36th place. It’s Kern’s first major appearance and the first event in which he’s competed against Tour professionals.

The ignition switch for him came when the 36-hole cut was announced at even par.

“About 10:30 Saturday morning, Kern said, “my shoulders relaxed and I knew that I could play some more golf on the best stage that there is.”

Kern added, “I’ve been surprised how relaxed I have been out there. This is a huge deal for me. It’s great for my family and everyone, being part of the PGA of America. It’s been phenomenal.

“I’m striking the ball better than I’ve ever been. I’m playing solid golf and it’s been a blast.”

Kern won the Texas State Open a week ago, and was just the second PGA Club Professional to win that prestigious state title. Prior to that, he said “the biggest jewel was July 3, 2017, when I got elected to PGA Membership.”

**TIGER 2000 VS. LONG JOHN DALY 1991**<br>Please note that the winner of the 100 Years of Greatness Bracket will be revealed during the first hour of CBS’ Sunday Final Round coverage of the PGA Championship (1:00 – 2:00 p.m. CT). The PGA of America announced earlier today that Tiger Woods and Bob May’s unforgettable duel at Valhalla in 2000 and John Daly’s historic victory in 1991 at Crooked Stick form the final matchup for online voters worldwide and through social media to determine the all-time greatest PGA Championship.
