**Family First**<br>2017 KitchenAid Senior PGA Champion Bernhard Langer’s devotion to family will not allow him to defend his KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship this week at Harbor Shores, as his youngest son, Jason, will be graduating from high school in Florida. Langer made the announcement last month during the Championship’s Media Day festivities. Despite his absence, Tuesday night’s Champions Dinner had a German flair and fare. Near the end of the festivities, Tom Lehman shared a few recollections of Langer to entertain those gathered. If Jason Langer’s name sounds familiar, it is likely because he and his father teamed to win the 2014 PNC Father-Son Challenge at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club's Grande Lake Orlando. Jason will begin playing golf this fall at the University of Pennsylvania. 

**First Majors First**<br>The three previous KitchenAid Senior PGA Championships staged at Harbor Shores have resulted in three champions that claimed the initial major championship victories of their respective careers: 2016/Rocco Mediate, 2014/Colin Montgomerie, and 2012/Roger Chapman. Mediate and Montgomerie have returned to Southwest Michigan this week, but Chapman is not in the field as he deals with an undisclosed injury.

**Horse for the Course**<br>David Frost makes his return to Benton Harbor sporting a perfect 3-for-3 top-ten record in the three KitchenAid Senior PGA Championships that have been held at Harbor Shores. The Paarl, South Africa and West Palm Beach, Florida resident posted a T4 in 2012, T5 in 2014, and T7 in 2016. The key to Frost’s success could be attributed to his putting, which ranked first, 14th, and 18th in the field in 2012, 2014, and 2016. Frost’s best finish in the Championship came in 2010 at Colorado Golf Club, where he finished runner-up after losing in a playoff to Tom Lehman.

The reigning KitchenAid Senior PGA Champion, Bernhard Langer, is the only other player to earn three top-ten finishes at Harbor Shores: 2012 – T4, 2014 – T3, 2016 – T3.

**Lexmark and the PGA Continue Environmental Support**<br>Since the 2012 Ryder Cup, the PGA of America and Lexmark, the Official Imaging and Printing Solutions Provider of the PGA of America, have planted trees to offset the impact of PGA of America-sanctioned championships. It’s a partnership that’s touched 11 different communities hosting PGA-sanctioned competitions.

The latest edition took place Monday, May 21, at Franks Park in Benton Harbor, where 18 trees and 7 shrubs were planted during constant rain by 20 volunteers in the ¾-acre park. Lexmark’s team also distributed 50 seedlings to the community, with City of Benton Harbor Parks & Recreation sending 35 seedlings to Morton Park and Charles Yarbrough Riverview Park. Additionally, the volunteers gathered 15 seedlings to plant in their favorite approved locations.

“Lexmark is proud to continue to work with the PGA of America,” said John D. Gagel, senior manager, Global Sustainability. “Our longstanding efforts to improve the communities in which we live and work while at the same time benefitting the environment, are a demonstration of the deep commitment we share.”    

**What’s it all mean to Benton Harbor?**<br>According to Lori Bolt, owner of Artemis Garden Design, LLC, the trees planted this week continue a positive tradition.

“Planting a tree is one of the easiest and most powerful things you can do to have a positive impact on the environment,” said Bolt. “A healthy tree can store 13 pounds of carbon each year. Overall, the planting this week will result in trees storing 975 pounds of carbon.”

**Pure Michigan Course Knowledge**<br>Brian Cairns, a PGA Teaching Professional at Fox Hills Learning Center in Plymouth, Michigan, may be the best “tourist” of Harbor Shores aside from the maintenance crew. Cairns estimated that he’s played the course “at least 25 times” as he prepares for his fourth consecutive KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship appearance.

**PGA Club Professionals Stake their Claim**<br>There are 41 PGA Club Professionals in the field this week, including 25 who have competed at Harbor Shores as least once since the 2012 KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship. The contingent includes 32 of 35 who earned a berth through last fall’s Senior PGA Professional Championship; and nine alternates. A quick glance at several:

* Jim Estes of Germantown, Maryland, co-founder of the Salute Military Golf Association, and the 2017 Low Club Professional. Estes is PGA Director of Instruction for Jim Estes Golf Services in Olney, Maryland.

* Roy Vucinich, 71, a PGA Life Member, who finished T-4 in 2002 at Firestone Country Club, is the oldest member of the field. He was the 1997-98 Senior PGA Professional Player of the Year.

* Vucinich and James Mason, a PGA Life Member from Dillard, Georgia, are each appearing in their 15th KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship.

* Jared Melson, 52, of Tullahoma, Oklahoma, is the last PGA Club Professional to gain a berth in the field (as an alternate). He is playing in his first event alongside Tour Professionals, and it happens to be a major championship. Melson is the PGA Head Professional at Bear Trace at Tims Ford in Winchester, Tennessee.
