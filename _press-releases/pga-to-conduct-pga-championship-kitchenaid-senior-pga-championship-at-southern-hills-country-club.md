PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. – The PGA of America announced today that it will host two different major championships at Southern Hills Country Club, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, between now and 2030.

Southern Hills will host the 2021 KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship—the most historic and prestigious major championship in senior golf—and also will be the venue for a PGA Championship no later than 2030.

This will be a record fifth time that Southern Hills has staged the PGA Championship, one of golf’s four men’s major championships. In 2021, the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship, the most historic event in senior golf, will make its second visit to Oklahoma as it debuts at Southern Hills.

Founded in 1936, Southern Hills has hosted seven previous major championships, beginning with the 1958 U.S. Open won by Tommy Bolt through Tiger Woods’ PGA Championship triumph in 2007, when he captured the Wanamaker Trophy for a fourth time.

Southern Hills also hosted the 1970 PGA Championship (won by Dave Stockton), 1977 U.S. Open (Hubert Green), 1982 PGA Championship (Raymond Floyd), 1994 PGA Championship (Nick Price) and 2001 U.S. Open (Retief Goosen).

“Few American golf venues match the legacy and record of excellence of Southern Hills Country Club,” said PGA of America President Paul Levy. “Some of our sport’s greatest names have walked these fairways and etched their name in major championship history. The PGA of America is proud to once again connect with Southern Hills, its membership and the great sports fans of Oklahoma. We are confident Southern Hills will continue to attract respective world-class fields for both the PGA Championship and the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship.”

With the announcement, Southern Hills’ history of hosting major golf championships will encompass more than 80 years. Southern Hills will also become the 13th venue to host both a PGA Championship and a KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship.

“We’re thrilled to again partner with the PGA of America and host a pair of championships of this caliber,” said Southern Hills President Craig Bothwell. “Major championship golf is a part of Southern Hills’ heritage, but we could not make this happen without the unending support of our dedicated membership, the sporting passion of the greater Tulsa community and the welcoming spirit of our proven volunteer network.”

The PGA Championship is the only all-professional major in men’s golf. It began in 1916, just months after the birth of the PGA of America and today features one of the deepest international fields in golf. Since 1994, it has perennially featured the most top-100 players in the Official World Golf Rankings of all golf Championships.

The KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship, which will celebrate its 82nd edition in 2021 at Southern Hills, was born in 1937 at Augusta National Golf Club, three years after the first Masters Tournament. The KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship is the most prestigious event in the game for PGA Members age 50-and-older.
