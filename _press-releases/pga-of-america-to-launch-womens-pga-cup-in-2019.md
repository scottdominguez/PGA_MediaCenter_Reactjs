### Top International Women PGA Members to Represent Their Respective Countries in Biennial Team Event

The PGA of America announced the formation of an international event, the Women’s PGA Cup – a first-of-its-kind team competition for women PGA Members from around the world.

The Women’s PGA Cup will be a 54-hole stroke play event with each team’s lowest three scores being counted after each round. The winning country will be the team with the lowest 54-hole aggregate total.

Each national team will be composed of five players and one Captain, who also may be a playing or non-playing captain at the option of the respective country.

The Women’s PGA Cup does not include a purse as each team will vie for bragging rights and the honor of winning the Cup, basking in the pride that comes with representing one’s country in a distinct and unique international competition.

Those eligible to represent their country in the Women’s PGA Cup must be Members in good standing with their respective Professional Golfers Association (PGA). They must also be active in the game, as a teacher, coach or working as Club Professional/Assistant. Tour professionals who primarily compete for a living are not eligible to participate.

“We’re excited to announce the Women’s PGA Cup, which will promote and highlight the exceptional playing ability of our female PGA professionals and afford them the opportunity to represent our country against their PGA counterparts from around the globe,” said PGA President Paul Levy. “The potential of this event is vast and we believe it will help grow women’s professional golf both domestically and internationally.”

The five members of the inaugural USA Team will be determined through an 18-month system that concludes on July 31, 2019, based on the following:

* Performance of eligible top-20 finishers in the 2018 & 2019 Women’s Stroke Play Championship and the 2018 & 2019 LPGA Teaching & Club Professional Championship
* Top 10 finishers in the final money list for the 2018 PGA Tournament Series
* Women PGA members making the cut at the 2018 and/or 2019 KPMG Women’s PGA Championship, the 2018 and/or 2019 USGA Women’s Open, and the 2018 and/or 2019 PGA Professional Championship
* Women PGA Members making the cut in any LPGA “Official” event from January 2018 thru July 31, 2019
* At the PGA Section level, points will be based on a formula that weighs both the number of eligible women PGA Members in each of the PGA of America’s 41 Sections with an individual’s prize money earned at the Section level

Beyond the United States, each participating country’s PGA Association will identify its captain and team through its own selection process. Likewise, each competing PGA Association will be responsible for selecting the criteria for captaincy.

The following countries are tentatively committed to play in the 2019 Women’s PGA Cup: Australia, Canada, Great Britain & Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden and the United States.

The site of the inaugural competition will be announced at a later date.
