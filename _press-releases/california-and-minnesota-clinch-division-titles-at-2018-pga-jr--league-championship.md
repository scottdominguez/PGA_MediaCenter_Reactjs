Having captured a national title three years ago, it was no surprise for undefeated Team California (San Diego 4-0-0) to clinch the Ryder Division title Sunday at the 7th PGA Jr. League Championship presented by National Car Rental at Grayhawk Golf Club.

However, an undefeated sleeper team in Team Minnesota (Blaine 4-0-0) caught virtually everyone by surprise in clinching the Wanamaker Division title. The two divisional champions are scheduled to face off Monday afternoon at 1:50 p.m. MT for the national title on the Raptor Blue Course (back nine).

Team California’s Ryan Abuan, 14, of Temecula; and Phillip Kench, 14, of Del Mar, each came within a whisker on their final hole Sunday afternoon of carding a birdie on all nine holes against Team Ohio. Instead, Abuan and Kench settled for eight straight birdies, one par and a starring role in helping Team California secure the top spot in the Ryder Division.<br><br>“I really wanted that putt on the last hole,” Kench said of narrowly missing a 15-foot downhill putt for a ninth birdie. “We just each burned the edge on both sides.”<br><br>Following a strong win of 10-2 against Washington, California defeated Ohio in the afternoon, 8-4.

“It was a really good round,” Abuan added about the overall day. “We got off to a hot start. The parents cheering gave us a lot of energy. We’re on a roll…we’re a strong team.”

Team Minnesota came away with wins against Illinois in the morning and Arkansas in the afternoon, both by 8-4 counts.

“We got off to a fast start in the morning versus Illinois,” said Team Minnesota Captain Jay Norman, PGA. “We took the first four flags. They came back, but we closed it out on the last three holes. Arkansas played us tough in the afternoon. We were biting our nails until the last two holes.”

Thanks to a coldsnap back home, Minnesota has had to turn its golf practice schedule on its top to prepare for the Championship. “We hadn’t played on a golf course since October 28," Norman explained. "We practiced at Topgolf once a week.”<br><br>Regardless of their practice schedule or location, it’s evident that this team has chemistry… and will carry their confidence into tomorrow’s sessions.“We’re the surprise team of the national tournament,” said Norman. “Nobody’s ever heard of us. Maybe we can sneak up on Team California, too.”

Ohio (Columbia Station 2-1-1) and Louisiana (Shreveport 2-1-1) will go head-to-head in the morning for the right to face either Texas (Montgomery 3-1-0) or Georgia (Duluth 2-1-1) for third-place Monday afternoon.

If Texas wins or ties versus Delaware (Wilmington 0-3-1), Texas will advance to the third-place round, thanks to Texas’ upset of Georgia 7 ½ to 4 ½ on Sunday afternoon. Should Texas lose on Monday morning, it would potentially open the door for last year’s Champion Team Georgia to have a shot at the third-place match.

However, Georgia will have to face Division Champ Minnesota in the final divisional section match in the morning. The match will serve as a tune-up for Minnesota prior to their afternoon Championship date with California, who will face Connecticut (Harwinton 0-4-0) in the morning to close out the team’s divisional play.

The 7th PGA Jr. League Presented by National Car Rental is being held at Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, Nov. 16-19.&nbsp; The Championship continues with Monday morning's fifth and final divisional session. Afterwards, the top four teams will play in Monday afternoon’s Championship session, with the top two teams in each division (California and Minnesota) playing for first and second place; and the two second-place teams from each division playing for third and fourth place.
