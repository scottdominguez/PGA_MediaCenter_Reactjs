PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. – The PGA of America announced today the 2021 Girls Junior PGA Championship will be contested at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. The 46th edition of the Championship will be held July 27-30.

“Our organization is delighted to bring the Girls Junior PGA Championship to Valhalla and the city of Louisville,” said PGA of America Chief Executive Officer Pete Bevacqua. “This event annually presents junior golf’s brightest and most talented girls with a significant test of golf. To combine this great Championship with the history and prestige of Valhalla Golf Club is a thrill, and we’re excited to see it play out in 2021.”

The Girls Junior PGA Championship features 144 players no older than 18 years of age at the time of competition. Contestants qualify for spots in the field through the PGA of America’s 41 section championships, as well as by earning exemptions from top-tier national tournaments.

Since the event’s introduction in 1976, a number of notable LPGA stars have competed in and won the Championship, including two-time winners: Inbee Park (2001, ’02), Lexi Thompson (2007, ’09), and Ariya Jutanugarn (2011, ’12).

Today’s announcement marks the second time the Championship will be held in the Bluegrass State. The 2018 Championship is currently being held at Kearney Hill Golf Links in Lexington. Valhalla will host the 2018 Boys Junior PGA Championship July 31 – August 3.

Designed by Jack Nicklaus, Valhalla opened for business in 1986 and has hosted several of golf’s most prominent championships and events, including: the 1996, 2000 and 2014 PGA Championships (won by Mark Brooks, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, respectively); the 2004 and 2011 KitchenAid Senior PGA Championships (Hale Irwin and Tom Watson); and the 2008 Ryder Cup (United States). The 2024 PGA Championship will also be staged at the Louisville property.

Under the direction of PGA General Manager and Director of Golf Keith Reese, Valhalla is ranked in Golf Digest's top 100 golf courses in the United States.
