PITTSFORD, N.Y. – The PGA of America announced today that Oak Hill Country Club in Pittsford, New York, will host the 80th KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship in 2019.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The most historic and prestigious championship in senior golf will be played for a second time on Oak Hill’s historic East Course, which was designed by Donald Ross in 1925.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In 2008 at Oak Hill, Jay Haas claimed his second Senior PGA Championship in three years by a single stroke over Bernhard Langer. At 7-over-par 287, Haas’ 2008 victory remains the highest scoring Championship since the event’s format shifted to 72 holes in 1958.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“We’re thrilled to return the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship to Oak Hill Country Club,” said PGA of America President Paul Levy. “The support we receive from Oak Hill’s membership and the Rochester community’s collective enthusiasm for golf are remarkable. As for the East Course, it provides a historical context that is rivaled by few in our sport.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Oak Hill’s relationship with the PGA of America is deep and ongoing. The East Course has staged three previous PGA Championships (2013, 2003, 1980) and will do so again in 2023 for a record-tying fourth time. Oak Hill was also the site of the 31st Ryder Cup in 1995, which Europe captured with a stunning final-day comeback, 14½ to 13½.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Other major and premier championships conducted at Oak Hill include the 1998 U.S. Amateur, 1989 U.S. Open, 1984 U.S. Senior Open, 1968 U.S. Open, 1956 U.S. Open, and 1949 U.S. Amateur. Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Cary Middlecoff, Curtis Strange and Jason Dufner headline Oak Hill’s roster of champions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“On behalf of the Board of Governors and the membership of Oak Hill, we are excited that our East Course will once again host this prestigious championship,” said Oak Hill Country Club President Tim Thaney. “We are honored that the PGA of America has offered Oak Hill the opportunity to showcase our East Course, our tremendous clubhouse facilities and the hospitality of the Rochester community. Oak Hill is proud to continue our relationship with the PGA of America.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Last year, Rocco Mediate surged past Colin Montgomerie and Langer to win the 77th KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship at Harbor Shores in Benton Harbor, Michigan.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>About the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship&nbsp;<br>The Senior PGA Championship was born in 1937 on the grounds of Augusta National Golf Club. Since then, famed champions such as Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Trevino, Raymond Floyd and Montgomerie have hoisted the Alfred S. Bourne Trophy, which stands 42 inches high, 18 inches wide and weighs 36 pounds.&nbsp;
