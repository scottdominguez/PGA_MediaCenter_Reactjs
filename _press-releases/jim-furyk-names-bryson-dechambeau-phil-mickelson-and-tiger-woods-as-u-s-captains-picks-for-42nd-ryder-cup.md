United States Ryder Cup Captain Jim Furyk today announced that Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods have been added to the U.S. Team as Captain’s selections for the 42nd Ryder Cup, which will be contested Sept. 28-30 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.

Eleven of the U.S. Ryder Cup Team’s 12 roster slots have now been filled. Furyk will disclose his fourth and final Captain’s selection on Monday, Sept. 10.

DeChambeau will be making his Ryder Cup debut, yet he will lean on valuable match-play experience gained in 2015, when he won the U.S. Amateur and went 2-0-1 for the U.S. Walker Cup team.

The 24-year-old DeChambeau (he’ll be 25 when Ryder Cup play begins) has won four times on the PGA Tour, including back-to-back victories the last two weeks in the The Northern Trust and Dell Technologies Championship. He’s currently No. 7 in the Official World Golf Ranking.

Mickelson, 48, will be playing in his record 12th Ryder Cup, as his appearance at Le Golf National will move him past Sir Nick Faldo, who played in 11 Ryder Cups for Europe. Mickelson has played in every Ryder Cup since 1995 and with 45 matches to his credit, he’s likely to pass Faldo (46) for most career matches played in the Ryder Cup.

A Captain’s pick for the first time, Mickelson won the 2018 WGC-Mexico Championship in March. The five-time major champion’s current standing in the Official World Golf Ranking is No. 24.

Woods will be playing in his eighth career Ryder Cup and his first since 2012. His 33 Ryder Cup matches played rank fifth all-time among Americans and his 4-1-2 career mark in singles includes an undefeated 2-0-1 mark on foreign soil.

The 42-year-old Woods is a 14-time major champion. He’s posted consecutive top-10s in majors, including a runner-up finish at last month’s PGA Championship at Bellerive. Woods is currently No. 26 in the Official World Golf Ranking.

Upon introducing his three newest U.S. Ryder Cup Team members, Furyk also announced that David Duval, Zach Johnson and Matt Kuchar would join Davis Love III and Steve Stricker as U.S. Vice Captains in Paris.
