### Activities to include Field of Flags display, 21-Gun Salute and free admission for those who served...

The PGA of America, in partnership with KitchenAid, is honoring those who served in the armed forces during this year’s KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship, May 24-27, in Benton Harbor, Michigan.

Fans entering the Championship will be greeted by the Avenue of Flags lining the entrance in tribute to our past and present American Heroes. Individual flags will also be on display at the Field of Flags, located inside the course, creating a panorama of red, white and blue.

“With the Championship being held over Memorial Day weekend each year, it is important that we continue to honor our troops,” said Ryan Ogle, championship director. “We hope attendees will visit the Field of Flags display and attend the 21 Gun Salute that takes place on Sunday of Championship week. It is important for golf fans, both in Benton Harbor and those watching at home, to remember those who served and sacrificed their lives for our country. We are proud to have a small part in that remembrance.”

On Sunday, May 27, members of the North Berrien Military Rites Team will present the country’s colors, play TAPS and fire a 21-Gun Salute at approximately 7:30 a.m. ET. In addition, members of the Whirlpool Veterans Association will serve as Hole 17 volunteer marshals and receive limited-edition KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship military uniforms provided by PGA REACH.

All Active Duty, Military Retirees, Active Reserve, National Guard, Department of Defense Civilians and their accompanying spouses, will be admitted free of charge to the Championship as part of the PGA of America’s commitment to various military initiatives and remembering the men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces.

#### What is the Difference Between Veterans Day and Memorial Day?

Many people confuse Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring military personnel who died in the service of their country, particularly those who died in battle or as a result of wounds sustained in battle. While those who died are also remembered, Veterans Day is the day set aside to thank and honor ALL those who served honorably in the military - in wartime or peacetime. In fact, Veterans Day is largely intended to thank LIVING veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to our national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served - not only those who died - have sacrificed and done their duty.
