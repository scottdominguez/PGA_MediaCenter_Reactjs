PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (November 1, 2018) – The PGA of America welcomed local and diverse suppliers to Farmingdale, New York, to provide sourcing opportunities in support of its 101st PGA Championship at Bethpage State Park’s Black Course.

Minority-, women-, LGBT- and Veteran-owned businesses were invited by the PGA to potentially participate in one of golf’s major championships within the $84.1 billion golf industry. Through outreach to diverse business organizations, the PGA provided opportunities for diverse and locally-owned suppliers to interview with larger prime, or tier one, suppliers engaged in the PGA Championship to be held May 13-19, 2019.

“We are pleased with the results of our outreach and are proud that high-quality partnerships are being forged as a result of the event,” said PGA of America Senior Director of Diversity & Inclusion Sandy Cross. “These partnerships will bring value, service and innovation to the PGA Championship supply chain. Our prime suppliers appreciate PGA providing a comprehensive process for identifying qualified diverse suppliers.”

Championships generate substantial entertainment and tourism dollars for host cities and surrounding areas. Accordingly, building a supply chain representative of the consumer population in these cities is imperative. More than 71 percent of participating diverse suppliers were local to the New York area and nearly a third were from the northeast region, including New Jersey, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.

“We show up and perform, especially when we have an organization like PGA advocating for us,” said Darrell Searcy, President, Chandler, Campbelle, & Daschle (CCD), a minority-owned business and past participant in the PGA’s supplier inclusion event that now works with prime supplier, The Convention Store, to deliver logistics and transportation for fans at Championships. “This gives us an opportunity to be introduced to businesses where we wouldn’t normally have an opportunity.We have to create a good value proposition as to why it makes sense to work with us.”

PGA partnered with Radius Sports Group, a woman-owned business, in early 2018 to elevate its supplier inclusion program, including outreach and facilitation of supplier inclusion events supporting PGA Championships and the Ryder Cup. Additional efforts include building a more robust database of local and diverse suppliers to potentially provide goods and services to the PGA directly as a prime supplier. Local and diverse-owned businesses may register within the database and be advised of future bid opportunities through the PGA social responsibility site: PGASupplierInclusion.org.
