**BROADHURST CAPTURES THE 2018 KITCHENAID SENIOR PGA CHAMPIONSHIP**<br>Paul Broadhurst, the 52-year-old Englishman, earned his second career senior major victory at the 2018 KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship. A final-round bogey-free 63, the best final-round score by a winner in this Championship, clinched the victory, as Broadhurst fended off runner-up, Tim Petrovic (69-269). Broadhurst’s 72-hole score (19-under 265) tied a Championship record, joining Rocco Mediate (2016) for the lowest 72-hole score.

Following a 1-over 72 on Thursday, Broadhurst proceeded to card rounds of 66 and 64 on Friday and Saturday, jumping from T77 to a solo third heading into Sunday’s final round. Broadhurst, playing in the penultimate group, became the first winner at Harbor Shores who was not paired in the final group and the first to do so in the Championship since 2013 (Kohki Idoki, Bellerive Country Club).

Broadhurst converted a combined 16 birdies over the weekend, and dropped only one stroke along the way. His 64 and 63 were the best in the field on Saturday and Sunday.

**SEVEN SENIOR MOMENTS TO REMEMBER**<br>Paul Broadhurst’s victory today in the 79th KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship was his fourth title since he debuted on the PGA Tour Champions two years ago in this Championship. In less than three years of senior golf, Broadhurst’s seven victories are one more than he tallied during 25-plus years on the European Tour (6). This was also Broadhurst’s third career victory stateside (2018 Bass Pro Shop Legends of Golf, 2016 Nature Valley First Tee Open at Pebble Beach).

**BROADHURST’S 54-HOLE SURGE OBLITERATES THREE-DAY SCORING MARK**<br>With scores of 66-64-63 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday respectively, Paul Broadhurst established a new Championship mark for low score on the event’s final 54 holes. Broadhurst’s closing 3-day (Friday-Sunday) tally of 193 easily bested the former record of 200, which was set by Michael Allen en route to winning the 2009 KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship at Canterbury Golf Club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**THE FIRST SINCE CHAPMAN & IDOKI**<br>Paul Broadhurst became the first Champion since Roger Chapman (2012) to win despite posting an over-par round. In addition, after trailing by five strokes following the first round, his victory marks the biggest comeback since Kohki Idoki (also five strokes).

**FANTASTIC WITH THE FLAT STICK**<br>If there was once facet of Paul Broadhurst’s game to credit for victory this week, it was his putting. Broadhurst led the field in Putts per Greens in Regulation (1.57), while ranking second in total putts (105).

**GOD SAVE THE QUEEN**<br>Players from the United Kingdom has won three of the four KitchenAid Senior PGA Championships played at Benton Harbor: Paul Broadhurst/2018, Colin Montgomerie/2014 and Roger Chapman/2012. American Rocco Mediate was the lone exception, as he hoisted the Alfred S. Bourne Trophy here in 2016.

**EUROPEAN UNION ON THE PGA TOUR CHAMPIONS**<br>Europeans have claimed the first two majors on the PGA Tour Champions schedule this year: England’s Paul Broadhurst/KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship and Spain’s Miguel Angel Jimenez/Regions Tradition.

**HISTORIC PETROVIC**<br>Tim Petrovic’s 15-under 269 places him behind Colin Montogomerie (16-under 268, 2016) in the Championship record book for the best 72-hole score by a non-winner.

**MONTY FINISHES STRONG**<br>Colin Montgomerie demonstrated yet another impressive display of golf in the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship. Four consecutive birdies from holes 8 to 11 catapulted Montgomerie up the leaderboard, where he finished in a tie for 6th (69-70-67-67-273). In his three appearances at Harbor Shores, he has finished each of his 12 rounds under par and is a combined 40-under-par. In addition to his finish on Sunday, Montgomerie has won the Championship twice (2014, ’15), finished runner-up (2016) and tied for 17th (2017).
