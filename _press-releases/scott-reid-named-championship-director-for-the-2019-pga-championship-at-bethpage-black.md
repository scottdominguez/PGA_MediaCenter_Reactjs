PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. – The PGA of America has named Scott Reid as Championship Director of the 2019 PGA Championship, which will be played at Bethpage State Park’s Black Course in Farmingdale, New York.

Reid spent the last 10 years as a Tournament Director, most recently for Pro Links Sports, for whom he managed the PGA Tour Champions’ Allianz Championship and The Sanford International. Prior to that, he directed championship operations for The RSM Classic and the Frys.com Open, both PGA Tour events.

A native of Scottsdale, Arizona, Reid’s golf career spans more than two decades and includes two years as Director of Sales and Marketing for the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, Florida. He was also Tournament Director (1994-99) and Marketing Director (2006-08) for the Southwest Section of the PGA of America.

"Scott’s depth of experience in championship operations is impressive, as is his connectivity with people and key stakeholders,” said Kerry Haigh, Chief Championships Officer of the PGA of America. "We’re very pleased to have Scott onboard as his leadership and vision will undoubtedly augment the rising anticipation for the 2019 PGA Championship at Bethpage Black."

Reid is a graduate of Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, where he was a member of the Antelopes golf team.
