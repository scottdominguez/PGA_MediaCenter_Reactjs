LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Aug. 2, 2018) - After a fog-delayed start to the continuation of the 2nd round of the 43rd Boys Junior PGA Championship--which stretched to Wednesday morning due to 1.75" of rain Tuesday--Nebraskan Luke Kluver is the sole leader heading into this afternoon's third round.

His 2-under par 70 (67-70 137) has him sitting atop the leaderboard at 7-under par. Kluver, of Norfolk, Nebraska, holds a one-shot lead over Ian Siebers, 16, of Bellevue, Washington, who held the lead overnight at 6-under par (70-68 138), until 54 players completed their second round today. William Moll, of Houston, is two shots off the pace, tied for third with Jackson Van Paris, of Pinehurst, North Carolina.

A pool of six players, including local standout Campbell Kremer, the great-grandson of Valhalla Golf Club founder Dwight Gahm, stand three shots back in a tie for fifth. Joining Kremer at 4-under par for the first two rounds are Travis Vick, also of Houston; Cole Ponich of Farmington, Utah; Nicolas Cassidy of Johns Creek, Georgia; Alexander Yang of Carlsbad, California; and Austin Greaser of Vandalia, Ohio.

First round co-leader Ryan Grauman, of Alamo, California, fell into a tie for 16th at 1-under par for the Championship. Defending champion Akshay Bhatia, of Wake Forest, North Carolina is T-22 at even par 144.

A cut has been made of the Top 70 players plus ties from the field of 144. Third round play is scheduled to begin today at 1 p.m. EDT on double tees. The final round will be conducted Friday.

Following the conclusion of play, the champion will receive the Jack Nicklaus Trophy. In addition, the 2018 United States Junior Ryder Cup Team will be announced by PGA Past President and U.S. Team Captain Allen Wronowski, PGA.
