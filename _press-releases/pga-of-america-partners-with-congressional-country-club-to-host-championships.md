The PGA of America announced today that Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, will host eight of its championships and events over the next two decades.

The landmark agreement will route the Ryder Cup (2036), PGA Championship (2031), KPMG Women’s PGA Championship (2022, ’27), KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship (2025, ’33), PGA Professional Championship (2029) and the Junior PGA Championship (Girls and Boys, 2024) to the Nation’s Capital and Congressional’s Blue Course during a 15-year stretch from 2022 to 2036. Congressional will also host an annual PGA HOPE national event, introducing golf to veterans, for the duration of the contract.

Conceived in 1921 so that Members of Congress could meet socially with business leaders, Congressional boasts a vaunted golf history that includes the 1976 PGA Championship won by Dave Stockton and a trio of U.S. Opens (2011/Rory McIlroy, 1997/Ernie Els, 1964/Ken Venturi). Congressional has also staged the 1995 U.S. Senior Open, the 1959 U.S. Women’s Amateur, the 1949 U.S. Junior Championship and three PGA Tour events a total of 15 times.

“This partnership with Congressional Country Club and its membership is monumental in scope and stature, and we are excited to showcase the range of championships and events that the PGA of America has to offer,” said PGA of America Interim CEO John Easterbrook. “We’re also looking forward to building a lasting relationship with the legions of knowledgeable golf fans from Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia and believe they will enjoy their time with us and marvel at the talents we will bring to Congressional in the coming years.” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

“Congressional Country Club is proud to be partnering with the PGA of America and looks forward to creating future championship history,” said Bev Lane, President of Congressional Country Club. “The PGA of America and its nearly 29,000 professionals represent the very best that golf has to offer. We are excited to bring major championship golf back to Congressional and to represent our country and the Nation’s Capital as the host of the 2036 Ryder Cup.”

Congressional’s world-renowned Blue Course was designed by Devereux Emmet in 1924, and has been renovated over the years by Donald Ross, Robert Trent Jones and most recently by Rees Jones. The course will undergo a full restoration, starting in 2019, led by Keith Foster.

The Ryder Cup, golf’s most compelling event, began in 1927, bringing together the finest tour professionals from the United States and Europe. Later this month, Europe will host the U.S. in the 42nd Ryder Cup in the shadows of Paris, at Le Golf National. In 2036, Congressional will host the 51st Ryder Cup.

The PGA Championship is the only all-professional major in men’s golf. It began in 1916, just months after the birth of the PGA of America, and today features one of the deepest international fields in golf. Since 1994, it has perennially featured the most top-100 players in the Official World Golf Rankings of all golf Championships.

The KPMG Women’s PGA Championship is a major-championship collaboration among the PGA of America, LPGA and KPMG, and focuses on the development, advancement and empowerment of women on and off the golf course. Formerly known as the LPGA Championship, the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship includes a women’s leadership summit (KPMG Women’s Leadership Summit) and an ongoing charitable initiative (KPMG Future Leaders Program) designed to inspire and develop new generations of women leaders.

“KPMG’s commitment to advancing, developing and empowering women is illustrated by the selection of Congressional Country Club as the host of the 2022 and 2027 KPMG Women’s PGA Championship,” said Lynne Doughtie, KPMG U.S. Chairman and CEO. “To help more women in business advance to the C-suite, the KPMG Women’s Leadership Summit will be held at Congressional and bring together top leaders across multiple industries with women nominated by their CEOs to attend.”

The KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship, which will celebrate its 86th and 94th editions at Congressional, was born in 1937 at Augusta National Golf Club, three years after the first Masters Tournament. The KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship is the most historic and prestigious major championship in senior golf.

Founded in 1968, the PGA Professional Championship brings together the finest playing PGA Club Professionals for the world’s largest all-professional event. Its field is comprised of players who advanced from the 41 PGA Section Championships, along with Past Champions. The low 20 scorers earn a berth in the subsequent PGA Championship.

Many of the world’s best players kick-started their careers at the Junior PGA Championship, a major championship for both Girls and Boys who have yet to reach their 19th birthday. Ariya Jutanugarn, Cristie Kerr, Inbee Park, and Lexi Thompson highlight the list of past champions for the Girls, while Phil Mickelson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Tiger Woods have all competed in the Boys.

PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere)—the flagship Military Program of PGA REACH—introduces golf to Veterans to enhance their physical, mental, social and emotional well-being. PGA REACH is the 501(c)(3) charitable foundation of the PGA of America.

All PGA HOPE programming is fully funded by PGA REACH and offered at no cost to Military Veterans. Led by PGA Member Jason Epstein, Congressional has hosted PGA HOPE programming since 2017.
