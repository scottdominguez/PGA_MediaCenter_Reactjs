PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. – The PGA of America has named Renee DeLosh as championship director of the 2019 KPMG Women’s PGA Championship, which will be held at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn.&nbsp;

A native of Michigan and a Twin Cities resident since 2008, DeLosh joined the PGA of America in 2013 and served as the primary contact for over 225 global customers before, during and after the Ryder Cup. In addition to her sales duties, DeLosh was a liaison for numerous host club committees.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"Renee is a leader and the relationships she has within the Hazeltine and Twin Cities communities will serve everyone well as we approach 2019,” said Kerry Haigh, Chief Championships Officer of the PGA of America. "As the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship continues to grow, Renee will be a key figure as we continue to advance our collaboration between the PGA, KPMG and the LPGA."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>DeLosh is a graduate of Michigan State University, where she earned a degree in business management. She enjoyed previous tenures in golf management and/or hospitality at Troon Golf, LinksCorp and Hyatt International.&nbsp;<br>​&nbsp;<br>"It is an honor to have a hand in ushering the return of women’s major championship golf to Hazeltine National Golf Club and the Twin Cities," DeLosh said. "Hazeltine is a special golf course and its membership has cultivated a welcoming environment for major championship golf. I’m excited for 2019 and plan to tap into the same passion for golf that was evident last fall during the Ryder Cup."&nbsp;
