### The resort will host the 2019 PGA Cup, Inaugural Women’s PGA Cup, Senior PGA Professional Championship and 2020 PGA Professional Championship &nbsp;

Beginning in 2019, Omni Barton Creek Resort & Spa of Austin, Texas, will host the 29th PGA Cup and the inaugural Women’s PGA Cup - the premier international competition for men and women PGA Professionals. Barton Creek also will be the site of the PGA’s two largest all-professional events, the 2020 PGA Professional Championship and the 2019 Senior PGA Professional Championship.

The PGA Cup, which matches 10-member United States and Great Britain & Ireland Teams in a Ryder Cup-style format, will be contested Sept. 23-29, 2019. The Women’s PGA Cup, Oct. 22-26, is a 54-hole stroke play event that is anticipated to attract five-member teams from Australia, Canada, Great Britain & Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden and the United States.

The PGA Cup and Women’s PGA Cup do not include a purse, with each team competing for their country and the right to claim two-year ownership of a silver Cup. The Women’s PGA Cup and PGA Cup will each be conducted on the Omni Barton Creek’s Fazio Foothills Course.

“This is an exciting time for the PGA of America to have our best playing men and women members showcased on an international and national stage at Omni Barton Creek Resort and Spa,” said PGA of America President Paul Levy. “Barton Creek offers a magnificent complex, and we are confident that its staff will be excellent hosts for unforgettable PGA Member championships.”

The 53rd PGA Professional Championship presented by Club Car and OMEGA in April 2020 will feature a 312-member nationwide field and conducted on a course rotation to be determined. The 31st Senior PGA Professional Championship presented by Golf Advisor in October 2019 has a 264-member field, and will be conducted on the Fazio Foothills and Coore Crenshaw Courses.

“We’re thrilled to welcome the PGA of America’s greatest players, including their peers from around the world and their fans, to one of Texas’ premier golf resorts,” said David Jurcak, managing director of Omni Barton Creek Resort & Spa. “In 2019, Omni will complete a $150 million transformation to the physical aspects of the property, ensuring the resort remains a top golf destination for many future generations.”

The PGA Cup began in 1973, and the United States owns a 17-7-4 advantage over Great Britain and Ireland. However, the Americans last claimed the Llandudno International Golf Trophy in 2013, with Great Britain & Ireland winning the last two meetings: a 13½ to 12½ decision in 2015; and a 16-10 victory in 2017.

The 2019 U.S. Team will be determined over a two-year point period spanning performances in the 2018 and 2019 PGA Professional Championships and the 2018 and 2019 PGA Championships.

The five U.S. members in the inaugural Women’s PGA Cup will be determined through an 18-month point system that concludes on July 31, 2019.

Begun in 1968, the PGA Professional Championship presented by Club Car and OMEGA is the showcase event for PGA Professionals and offers a $550,000 purse. The field includes players advancing from Sectional Championships, past Champions and the top 20 players and ties from the previous year’s Championship. The low 20 scorers in 2020 at Barton Creek earn a berth in the 2020 PGA Championship at Harding Park Golf Club in San Francisco.

The Senior PGA Professional Championship presented by Golf Advisor originated in 1989, and has become one of the most popular competitions for PGA Professionals age 50 and older. The Championship has served as a stepping stone to many players to compete for a spot on the PGA Tour Champions. The low 35 scorers in the 2019 Senior PGA Professional Championship earn a berth in the 2020 KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship at Harbor Shores in Benton Harbor, Michigan.
