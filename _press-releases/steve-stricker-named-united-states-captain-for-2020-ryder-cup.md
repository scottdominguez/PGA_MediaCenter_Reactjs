MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN (February 20, 2019) – PGA of America President Suzy Whaley today announced that Steve Stricker will serve as the United States Ryder Cup Team Captain for the 43rd Ryder Cup, which will be played September 22-27, 2020 at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin.

Stricker becomes the 29th U.S. Captain since the Ryder Cup’s inception in 1927.

A native of Edgerton, Wisconsin (located 95 miles southwest of Whistling Straits), Stricker made his Ryder Cup debut in 2008 (at the age of 41) and played in three consecutive Ryder Cups (2008, ‘10, ‘12).

“Steve Stricker's career has long established a place of prominence in American golf," said Whaley, who joined Stricker for an introductory news conference in Milwaukee. “Yet, he’s as relevant as ever – as evidenced by three wins last year on the PGA Tour Champions – and he has a wonderful ability to connect with players of all ages. Steve’s vision for his Captaincy is laser focused and we are elated to have this hometown favorite as our U.S. Ryder Cup Captain for 2020 at Whistling Straits.”

The 51-year-old Stricker was a member of winning U.S. Ryder Cup efforts in 2008 and ‘16, the latter as a Vice Captain. A 12-time winner on the PGA Tour, Stricker also played in five Presidents Cups, an event at which he served as victorious U.S. Captain in 2017.

“In our sport, in this country, there is no greater honor than to Captain the United States Ryder Cup Team,” said Stricker, who was inducted into the Wisconsin State Golf Association Hall of Fame in December 2007. "I am humbled by both the opportunity at hand and the responsibility that comes with the position. I'd like to thank the PGA Ryder Cup Committee for their belief in me.

“While we were disappointed with the result in Paris, I am confident the setback will fuel our preparations for what will take place at Whistling Straits. Europe's talent will present a great challenge, but we will be focused on what we can accomplish together in 2020 in my home state, in front of a loyal legion of sports fans in Wisconsin. It's going to be a memorable week."

In his first act as Ryder Cup Captain, Stricker named Jim Furyk as the first of his Vice Captains. Furyk served as U.S. Captain in 2018 and played in nine Ryder Cups.

Padraig Harrington, 47, of Ireland was named 2020 European Ryder Cup Captain last month.

The selection criteria for the 2020 U.S. Ryder Cup Team was also announced.
