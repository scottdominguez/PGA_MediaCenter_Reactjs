**PARIS, FRANCE and MILWAUKEE, WIS. (Sept. 24, 2018)** – The 2020 Junior Ryder Cup will be held at historic Blue Mound Golf and Country Club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sept. 21-22, 2020.

Established in 1903, the famed Seth Raynor-designed 6,666-yard Blue Mound golf course is renowned for playing host to the 1933 PGA Championship, won by Gene Sarazen over Willie Goggin 5 and 4 at match play—the third and final time “The Squire” would win the Wanamaker Trophy. In 1940, Blue Mound played host to the U.S. Women’s Western Open, famously won by Babe Zaharias.

More recently, the Club hosted the 2010 Western Golf Association Junior Championship and co-hosted the 2011 U.S. Amateur Championship. Over the past several years, “Mr. Raynor’s Masterpiece” has undergone a restoration project that has brought it back to the intent of its original design and glory. Golf Digest ranks the course and the “Blue Mound Experience” among the Top 200 in the game.

“When America takes its turn in hosting the Junior Ryder Cup in 2020, it will be contested at such a historic golf venue in Blue Mound Golf and Country Club,” said PGA President Paul Levy. “We’re excited to convene the best junior golfers from both the United States and Europe, as they compete at the highest of levels for what has become one of the most sought-after events in junior golf.”

For the 12th Junior Ryder Cup, both the United States and European Teams will feature six boys and six girls who are members of the high school graduating class of 2021, or younger.

“It is a special honor to welcome some of the best junior golfers in the world to Blue Mound Golf and Country Club for the 2020 Junior Ryder Cup,” said Blue Mound PGA Director of Golf Barry Linhart. “Blue Mound is delighted to host this prestigious international event, as we proudly showcase our magnificent course and the future stars of the game.”

The idea for the Junior Ryder Cup came about in 1995, when a team of Europeans played an informal exhibition match against the Central New York PGA Section and area juniors. Two years later, the Junior Ryder Cup was formally introduced as an event in its own right, while played at Alcaidesa Links Golf Course, in Cadiz, Spain, and won by America, 9-7.

Among the Junior Ryder Cup alumni are major champions, PGA Tour and LPGA Tour players including: Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Hunter Mahan, Tony Finau, Lexi Thompson, Alison Lee and Brittany Altomare of the United States; and Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Nicolas Colsaerts, Suzanne Peterson, Emily Pedersen and Carlota Ciganda of Europe.
