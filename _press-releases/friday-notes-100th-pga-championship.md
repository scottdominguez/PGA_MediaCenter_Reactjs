**SECOND-ROUND PLAY SUSPENDED**<br>Second-round play in the 100th PGA Championship was suspended at 3:35 p.m. (CT) due to dangerous weather conditions and did not resume. The second round will resume on Saturday at 7:00 a.m.

The Championship’s third round will be played in groups of three, with players going off both the first and 10th tees. The third round will begin approximately 30 minutes after the completion of round 2.

**GOOD WOODLAND**<br>At 10-under par, Gary Woodland leads the PGA Championship, although the second round has yet to be completed. Woodland’s 10-under tally through 36 holes is the furthest under-par he has reached in a major championship and stands in stark contrast to his cumulative 30-over score in 10 major championship rounds this season, prior to his arrival at Bellerive this week.

**LOW 36**<br>Woodland set the lowest 36-hole total in PGA Championship history at 130 (64-66). The previous record (131) had been held by nine other players, most recently Jimmy Walker and Robert Streb in 2016.

**PAIR OF 63s AT BELLERIVE**<br>Both Brooks Koepka and Charl Schwartzel carded 63s on Friday morning at Bellerive to match the low 18-hole score in PGA Championship history and matched the course record for Bellerive Country Club, which opened in 1960. Koepka and Schwartzel became the 15th and 16th players to card a 63 in PGA Championship play. Before Friday, the Championship’s most recent 63 was authored by Robert Streb (second round) in 2016 at Baltusrol.

DJ Trahan had previously owned the Bellerive competitive course record, a 63 in the second round of the 2008 BMW Championship.

This was the first time in PGA Championship history that a single round yielded a pair of 63s. Before today, only once in the 100-year history of the Championship had two 63s been carded in the same year: Michael Bradley (first round) and Brad Faxon (fourth round) at the 1995 PGA at Riviera.

**SPIETH SLAM STILL ALIVE AT BELLERIVE**<br>After a first-round 71, Jordan Spieth posted a bogey-free 66 on Friday to move up the leaderboard into his current position of T-23. Spieth is seeking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam and would do so with a victory at Bellerive.

**TEXAS PGA CLUB PROFESSIONAL BEN KERN IN POSITION TO MAKE THE CUT**<br>Ben Kern of Abilene Texas, the PGA Head Professional at Georgetown (Texas) Country Club, birdied the 18th hole Friday for a 1-under-par 69 to post a 36-hole total of even-par 140. That left him in strong position to make the cut.

Should Kern make the cut, which currently is even par, he would become the second consecutive Southern Texas PGA Member to play the weekend in the PGA Championship. Omar Uresti of Austin, Texas, made the cut in 2017 at Quail Hollow Club.

The PGA Club Professional delegation at Bellerive featured players representing 15 PGA Sections and 15 states. Craig Hocknull of Gilbert, Arizona, and Sean McCarty of Solon, Iowa – each making their Championship debut – were at 3-over-par, and unable to complete the second round due to a heavy rainstorm passing over Bellerive.

**PGA CHAMPIONSHIP SECOND ROUND TV COVERAGE TO RESUME SATURDAY**<br>TNT and PGA.com’s coverage of the 100th PGA Championship will continue with the conclusion of second round play starting at 7 a.m. CT on Saturday, August 11.

CBS third round coverage will begin at 1 p.m. CT.

Third round Featured Groups coverage for PGA.com will be determined at the completion of the second round.
