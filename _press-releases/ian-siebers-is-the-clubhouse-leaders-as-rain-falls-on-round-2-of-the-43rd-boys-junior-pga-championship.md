LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Aug. 1, 2018) – A total of 1.75” of heavy rain put a damper on the second round of the 43rd Boys PGA Championship Wednesday at Valhalla Golf Club. Play was first suspended for three hours and 17 minutes during the downpour. Then, 54 players of the 144-player field went back out on the course, until play was suspended due to darkness at 8:45 p.m. EDT.

Sixteen-year-old Ian Siebers, of Bellevue, Washington, shot an impressive 4-under par 68 (70-68 138) to catapult into the clubhouse lead. Siebers turned in a clean card with four birdies versus no bogeys.

William Moll, 17, of Houston, currently stands second in the clubhouse at 5-under par for the Championship, following a 1-under par 71 (68-71 139). Starting on the back nine, Moll overcame four bogeys overall, with five birdies respectively on Nos. 17, 18, 2, 4 and 7.

“I got my putter rolling, and I worked a little on my swing,” said Moll, a Vanderbilt University commit. “I feel I am in a good position.”

Among those that finished their round, four players are in a tie for third at 4-under par. This includes Travis Vick, 18, also of Houston, who matched Moll with a 71 for the day (69-71 140). His scorecard also reflected a five birdie to four bogey round.

Also in the group is 1st Round co-leader Campbell Kremer, who cooled off with a 2-over-par 74 (66-74 140), following a personal best six-under par 66 on Tuesday. Kremer is the great-grandson of Valhalla founder Dwight Gahm.

“I still have a lot of confidence in the course, and I think I should play well the next two days,” said Kremer.

BYU commit Cole Ponich, 18, of Farmington, Utah, shot an even par-72 (68-72 140) to also have a share of third—among finishers on the day—while University of Georgia commit Nicolas Cassidy, 17, of Johns Creek, Georgia, carded a 1-under par 71 (69-71 140).&nbsp;

Still on the course are two players tied at 6-under par for the overall lead. First round co-leader Ryan Grauman, of Alamo, California is even-par through nine holes carded. Luke Kluver, of Norfolk, Nebraska is 1-under for his round through 11 holes played. Also on the course is defending champion Akshay Bhatia who is 3-over par through eight holes and is currently T-18 overall.

The second round will resume Thursday at 7:30 a.m. Upon completion of the second round, a cut will be made with the Top 70 players and ties advancing to the third round, which will start approximately at noon. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
