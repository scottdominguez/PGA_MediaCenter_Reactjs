**THE FIELD FOR THE 100TH PGA CHAMPIONSHIP**<br>The 156-player field for the 100th PGA Championship at Bellerive includes 98 of the top 100 world-ranked players according to the latest Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR). This is once again the strongest field in golf this year. Sixty-seven international players from 25 countries will tee it up this week. There are also 31 Major Champions in the field who have combined to capture 62 major titles. Fifteen of those 31 major champions are PGA Champions, including each of the last 14 winners. Twenty PGA Professionals are again among the field, and they are representing 16 of the 41 PGA Sections nationwide.

**JUSTIN’S DOUBLE VISION**<br>This week at Bellerive, Defending Champion Justin Thomas will not only be attempting to become the second repeat PGA Champion in the stroke play era (Tiger Woods accomplished the rare feat twice: 2000-01 and 2006-07). A victory in St. Louis would also make Thomas the first player to win the PGA Championship and the event immediately preceding it since 2014, when Rory McIlroy won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship at Valhalla in consecutive weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;

**WELCOME BACK**<br>Three players in the field this week at Bellerive also competed in the 1992 PGA Championship played here: John Daly (1991 PGA Champion, finished 82nd in ‘92), Davis Love III (1997 PGA Champion, T-33 in ’92) and Vijay Singh (1998 & 2004 PGA Champion, T-48 in 1992).&nbsp;

**SHOW ME STATE CONNECTIONS**<br>Two players in the field this week, John Daly and Michael Block, have strong connections to Missouri. Daly was born in California, and was raised in Arkansas, but he attended Helias High School in Jefferson City, Missouri. While at Helias, he won a state championship in golf. Block, meanwhile, was born in Nevada, but was raised in St. Louis. He attended middle school at Parkway Central, which is just one mile from Bellerive. Block later went on the play college golf and graduate from the University of Missouri at St. Louis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**IT’S BEEN AWHILE**<br>Even with the withdrawal of Lee Westwood over the weekend, there will still be 14 Englishmen at Bellerive this week attempting to end their homeland’s 99-year PGA Championship victory drought. The first and only native of England to win the PGA Championship was Jim Barnes, who claimed the initial two Championships in 1916 and 1919.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**NEW FACES IN MAJOR PLACES**<br>Ten of the 12 majors dating to Jason Day’s PGA Championship victory at Whistling Straits in 2015 have been won by first time major championship winners. The two exceptions: Brooks Koepka (2018 U.S. Open) and Jordan Spieth (2017 Open Championship).

**WELCOME TO THE PGA CHAMPIONSHIP, JOAQUIN**<br>Joaquin Niemann of Chile, 19, ranked No. 163 in the Official World Golf Rankings, is the youngest member of the field at Bellerive Country Club. He is also making his PGA Championship debut. This year, Niemann became the youngest player since Sergio Garcia in 1999 to accept Special Temporary Membership on the PGA Tour. Given the opportunity, Niemann required just eight starts to earn his Tour card for 2019.&nbsp;

**VETERANS CELEBRATE THIRD ANNUAL SECRETARY’S CUP**<br>New Jersey’s PGA HOPE team shook off the effects of a 13-hour van ride, which was precipitated by a powerful northeastern storm Friday afternoon, and captured a second straight title Sunday in the 2018 Secretary’s Cup sponsored by Express Scripts. Anchored by PGA Professional Pete Stefanchik of Somerset, New Jersey; Ret. Air Force Airman First Class Glenn Hockman of Basking Ridge, New Jersey; and Ret. Army Sgt. Charlie Wilcox of Hackettstown – who drove the van virtually the entire 950 miles – the quintet posted a 7-under-par 29 in the nine-hole scramble event at Whitmoor Country Club. St. Louis’ No. 3 Team, guided by PGA Professional Jon DePriest, the PGA General Manager of Sunset Hills Country Club in Edwardsville, Illinois, was runner-up at 31.

Begun in 2016 and named in tribute to the Secretary of the Veterans Administration, the Secretary’s Cup nine-hole scramble match brought together 13 PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) programs. The field featured eight teams from the host Gateway PGA Section, along with one squad each from the Carolinas, Metropolitan, New Jersey, Northern California and Philadelphia Sections. The event celebrates the PGA HOPE program, which uses golf as a rehabilitation tool for military Veterans.
