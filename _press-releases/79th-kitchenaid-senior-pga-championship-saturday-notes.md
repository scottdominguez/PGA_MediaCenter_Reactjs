**TWO TIED AT THE TOP AT THE KITCHENAID SENIOR PGA CHAMPIONSHIP**<br>Tim Petrovic (65 on Saturday) and Scott McCarron (66) and are tied for the lead, at 13-under-par 200, after three rounds of the 79th KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship at Harbor Shores in Benton Harbor, Michigan. McCarron and Petrovic are two shots clear of Paul Broadhurst (third-round 64, low round of the Championship), who is in third place. Miguel Angel Jimenez is alone in fourth at 204, while a pack of four, including Jerry Kelly, is five off the pace (205).&nbsp;

**WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF “PETRO GOLF”**<br>During the first two days of the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship, Tim Petrovic introduced “Petro Golf” to the golf vernacular and shared its meaning: to hit fairways and greens. Petrovic has done just that through three rounds, as he’s hit 36/39 fairways (92.3%, tied for fifth in the Championship) and 44/54 greens in regulation (81.5%, tied for second in the Championship).

**BROADHURST MAKES HIS MOVE**<br>Following a modest first-round tally of 72, England’s Paul Broadhurst has risen up the standings and currently sits in 3rd place (two back of the lead). On Saturday, he bettered his second-round 5-under 66 with a 7-under 64. This tied the lowest third-round 18-hole score in the Championship, an honor he now shares with Chandler Harper, 1968 (Pecan Valley Golf Club); Roger Chapman, 2012 (Harbor Shores); and Marco Dawson, 2014 (Harbor Shores).

The drastic difference between his first round and the past 36 holes could be credited to his accuracy into the green. After hitting only 10 of 18 greens (56%) during round one, Broadhurst has sharpened his game and reached 27 of 36 (75%) the past two rounds. This accuracy contributed to a combined 15 birdies on Friday and Saturday.

**54-HOLE LEADS AT HARBOR SHORES**<br>The 54-hole leader/co-leader has won all three times the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship has been played at Harbor Shores.

- 2016: Rocco Mediate led by two at 14-under and went on to win by three at 19-under.<br>- 2014: Colin Montgomerie led by one at 7-under and went on to win by four at 13-under.<br>- 2012: Roger Chapman led by five at 14-under and went on to win by two at 13-under.

**GOD SAVE THE QUEEN**<br>Roger Chapman/2012 and Colin Montgomerie/2016 won two of the initial three KitchenAid Senior PGA Championships played at Harbor Shores. Paul Broadhurst (England), who is two back in solo third, appears to have the best odds of reestablishing the United Kingdom’s grip on the Alfred S. Bourne Trophy among those to claim victory in Southwest Michigan, although Montgomerie (Scotland, tied-9th) and Chris Williams (England, tied-9th) are still within shouting distance of the leaders.

**MULTIPLE MAJORS**<br>Three players within the top five are seeking to double their senior major championship total. 54-hole co-leader Scott McCarron (2017 Constellation Senior Players Championship), Paul Broadhurst (Third place; 2016 Senior Open Championship) and Miguel Angel Jimenez (Fourth place; 2018 Regions Tradition) have each captured a senior major.

**MAIDEN VICTORY ON THE LINE**<br>The following players in the top five are in pursuit of their first career senior major victory: Tim Petrovic (T1), Bob Estes (T5), Tom Byrum (T5), Jerry Kelly (T5), and Kevin Sutherland (T5). Each of the three KitchenAid Senior PGA Champions at Harbor Shores (Roger Chapman, 2012; Colin Montgomerie, 2014; Rocco Mediate, 2016) were first-time senior major winners.

**TOM BYRUM COMES UP ACES**<br>Tom Byrum of San Antonio, Texas, recorded a hole-in-one in Saturday’s third round of the 79th KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship, using a 6-iron on the 184-yard No. 17 hole at Harbor Shores.

It was the second ace in three years when the Championship has visited Benton Harbor, Michigan. Mike Reid made a hole-in-one in 2016. It was Byrum’s second career ace on the PGA Tour Champions, following two as a PGA Tour Member, and the fifth overall hole-in-one posted this year on the PGA Tour Champions.

Byrum went on to finish with a 4-under-par 67, his best performance in 23 rounds in the Championship.

**TWO LOCAL KITCHENS ARE GETTING A FACE LIFT**<br>The first two winners of the $5,000 KitchenAid Shopping Spree have been announced. Kimberly Connor from St. Joe and Floyd Jackson from Baroda are our first two winners, and two more lucky Championship attendees will be identified before the weekend concludes. All ticket holders have a chance to win by scanning their tickets at any “Scan and Win” location.
